# Program

Not much time, but here are the topics I think we should touch upon:

--

- Hidden features of the RStudio IDE

- Good project management practice

- RMarkdown

- The Tidyverse

- Maps

- Random stuff that come up over the next couple of hours 

---

# RStudio IDE

100% of respondents to the pre workshop survey use RStudio...

Let's have a look around - live demo

---

# Projects

Use a project-oriented workflow

--

- Have a directory dedicated to your project
- Create an RStudio project
- (make this a git repo)

---

# What are the benefits?

--

- RStudio rembers settings, open files, unsaved files(!), etc
- Dedicated instance of RStudio
- Dedicated **R** process
- File browser is looking the right place
- WD is at the right place
